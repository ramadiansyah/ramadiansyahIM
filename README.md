# Yahoo! Messenger J2ME Client  

This repository contains my **Final Project** from 2009, where I developed a Yahoo! Messenger application using **J2ME** and **jYMSG** (which I stripped down).  

At the time, Yahoo! Messenger was a widely popular instant messaging platform, and I aimed to create a mobile client for it. However, this project is now **obsolete** as Yahoo! Messenger no longer exists.  

You can see a simulation of this application in action when it was still functional in this blog post:
