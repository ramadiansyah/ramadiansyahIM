# Yahoo! Messenger J2ME Client  

This repository contains my **Final Project** from 2009, where I developed a Yahoo! Messenger application using **J2ME** and **jYMSG** (which I stripped down).  

At the time, Yahoo! Messenger was a widely popular instant messaging platform, and I aimed to create a mobile client for it. However, this project is now **deprecated** as Yahoo! Messenger no longer exists.  

I am preserving it here on GitHub for archival purposes.  

## üìå **Project Details**  
- **Year:** 2009  
- **Technology:** J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition)  
- **Library Used:** jYMSG (modified)  
- **Status:** Deprecated (no longer in use)  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**  
- This project is no longer maintained.  
- The Yahoo! Messenger service was officially shut down in 2018.  
- The code is kept here for historical and educational purposes.  

## üìÇ **Repository Purpose**  
This repository serves as a **personal archive** of my past work. Feel free to explore the code, but note that it is not functional anymore.
